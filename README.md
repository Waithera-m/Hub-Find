## Technologies Used
* HTML - HTML dictates the structure of webpages. The hypertext language was used to create the form to collect users date. 
* CSS & Bootstrap - CSS determines the appearance of webpages. The styling language was used to add background images and colors and style the site's content.
* [Angular-Cli](https://angular.io/) - version 9.0.5. -  Angular is a TypeScript-based framework. The framework's components were used to refactor code and promote code maintenance. Inbuilt and custom directives, such as ngFor and ngIf, in turn, were used to loop through the repos array. A custom pipe was also used to calculate and display the age of different GitHub accounts.
